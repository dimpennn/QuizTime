```

## Routing

Configured in `src/app/AppRoutes.jsx`.

- / - Quizzes list
- /my-quizzes - Current user's quizzes
- /login - Login page
- /register - Registration page
- /results - Results list
- /help - Help page
- /profile - Current user profile
- /quiz/:quizId - Quiz attempt page
- /result/:quizId/:resultIdParam - Quiz result details page
- /create - Quiz creation page
- /manage/:quizId - Quiz edit/manage page
- /user/:userId - Public profile page
-   -   - Not found page

## Configuration

Global app constants are centralized in `src/shared/config/config.js`.

It currently includes:

- API pagination limits (`API_CONFIG`)
- Validation/form constraints (`QUIZ_CONSTRAINTS`)
- Auto-reload timeout (`AUTO_RELOAD_CONFIG`)
- Color animation settings (`COLOR_ANIMATION_CONFIG`)
- Sort options labels and ids (`SORT_OPTIONS`)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended)
- npm 9+

## Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd QuizTime
npm install
```

Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

Notes:

- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is consumed in `src/app/main.jsx` by `GoogleOAuthProvider`.
- `VITE_API_URL` is consumed in `src/shared/api/client.js` as `API_URL`.
- `AUTH_URL` is derived from `API_URL` by replacing `/api` with `/auth`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server.
- `npm run build` - Create production build.
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally.
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint.

## Backend Integration

The frontend expects a backend that provides these route groups:

- `/auth` (register, login, Google auth, verification code, account link)
- `/api/quizzes`
- `/api/results`
- `/api/user`

Auth token behavior:

- Token is read from localStorage key `token`.
- User object is read from localStorage key `user`.
- Authorization header uses `Bearer <token>` when available.

## Deployment

Vercel SPA rewrite is configured in `vercel.json`:

- All routes are rewritten to `/index.html`.

Build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output directory:

- `dist`

## Troubleshooting

- Google login fails immediately: verify `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set correctly.
- API requests fail in development: confirm backend is running and verify `VITE_API_URL` usage in `src/shared/api/client.js`.
- Refreshing non-root routes returns 404 in production: ensure hosting has SPA rewrite support (already set for Vercel).
